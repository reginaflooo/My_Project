# Python - 13/03

##### To Do when using school's comp:
1. Log in to Git, and Teams 
2. Open terminal and download git by enterring once and typing 'git' and enter
3. Open VSC and open repository through git 
4. If a problem of configuration occurs when pushing to the github, go to the terminal (Mac) and enter:
<git config --global user.name "NAME">
<git config --global user.email "EMAIL ADDRESS">
5. When using python on VSC, download the python extension as well

The template (steps) for programming with Python: 
1. Input 
2. Process
3. Output 

### Using Python Language in VSC
To use the language (or any language) put the code information behind the file name. For python: .py
Ex: filename.py

Capital letters MAKE a difference in python (pay attention to this)

### Variables 
Variables are 'containers' for values. Data of varibles can be from inputs or from processes along the way.

### Functions
In Python, we use FUNCTIONS (or commands) to execute an action 

1. The < print > function is used to display an output

<print('Hello World')>

<print(f'This is the data in variable x: {x}')>

the use of 'f' in the print function is to format your string to be readable. The data inside ' ' is of string format with {} being variables.
